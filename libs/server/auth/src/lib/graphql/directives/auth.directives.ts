/**
 * The AuthDirective use the auth guards. These functions just wrap the resolvers and call them if they don't throw.
 *
 * Because of this the order of function wrapping matters. That is the 'activeUser' must be wrapped by the 'authenticated'
 * guard. How Schema directives are applied at either a type or field level means that they must check each if 'down stream' directives
 * are applied to the field and do NOTHING if they are. The down stream directive will then wrap the resolver with the required guards.
 *
 * e.g. The top level 'Query' field has the '@authenticated' directive applied. All this does is check the Bearer token is valid.
 * If at a later field (or Type), the  '@activeUser` directive is applied, if no checks were done then it would wrap the authenticated
 * middleware, not the other way around as the '@activeUser' middleware requires the '@authenticated' to run first
