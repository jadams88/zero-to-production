  A monorepo has many benefits, one if which is code sharing of libraries. The
  Todo Application below is it's own standalone application of which almost all
  of its code base is comprised of imported libraries that together makes up the
  application (Auth, Dashboard, Todos etc). As the application itself is just
  another library, it can be imported into other applications.

<h4>NOTE</h4>
<p>
  The application below is a complete working application with a live GraphQL
  API hosted on Google Cloud Kubernetes as provided in this repo (<em
    >apps/server/api/</em
  >
  ). You will have to register before you can log in.
</p>
<p>
  For privacy reasons the API has been configured to accept dummy data (so not
  to collect any sensitive information). The email address you provide does
  <b>NOT</b> have to be unique and will note be 'verified' so go ahead and put
  <b>test@email.com</b> or similar as it only needs to satisfy the email
  validation. Your username is the only thing required to be unique for
  registration to be successful.

  The Database will be wiped regularly so don't be surprised if you come back
  next week and its all gone.
