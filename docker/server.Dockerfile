# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Multi build file - One for building our app and one for production
#
# Seperate containers so that the production container does not
# Contain all the development dependencies and source files, only
# output .js files and production dependencies
# ----------------------------------------------------------

# NOTE: The .dockerignore needs to explicitly allow files to be 'visible' or the build will fail

# ----------------------------------------------------------
# Docker cachs intermediate containers when building images
# and uses the cached containers if there has been no changes to 
# the build before that current step. Becuase of this, it is best
# to install all dependencies at the start so that they are cached and 
# any subsequent changes to source files, libs etc will no require deps to be
# reinstalled. Only changes to your config files will cause reinstalling
# of dependencies.
